My Expereince: 
As a virtual Associate Scientist at LifeArc, I had the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in the fundamentals of scientific research. In the initial phase of this role, I worked on designing a multiplexed experiment to optimize an in vitro neuronal differentiation protocol. The platform provided a structured approach to learning, promoting efficiency and effectiveness through step-by-step guidance and a diverse collection of tools and content.

This part-time experience not only allowed me to work independently but also expanded my understanding of various techniques and subject areas. The knowledge I acquired has been invaluable, significantly enhancing the quality of my practical work at the university.

I plan to continue utilizing this platform extensively and applying its research insights to further refine my work in academia and beyond
