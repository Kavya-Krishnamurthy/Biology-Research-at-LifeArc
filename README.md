# Biology Research at LifeArc
Job : Learn how to optimise experimental conditions, analyse data to determine optimal conditions, synthesise evidence and collaboration and present your results.
1. Design a multiplexed experiment to optimise an in vitro neuronal differentiation protocol
2. Analyze experimental data to find the best treatment combination.
3. Apply logistic regression, a key statistical framework.
4. Data analysis using R
5. analyze combined experimental data.
6. Assess efficiency in generating functional nociceptor neurons.
7. Formulate conclusions and recommendations based on the data.


As a Associate scientist at LifeArc, I had the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in the fundamentals of scientific research. In the initial phase of this role, I worked on designing a multiplexed experiment to optimize an in vitro neuronal differentiation protocol. The platform provided a structured approach to learning, promoting efficiency and effectiveness through step-by-step guidance and a diverse collection of tools and content.

This part-time experience not only allowed me to work independently but also expanded my understanding of various techniques and subject areas. The knowledge I acquired has been invaluable, significantly enhancing the quality of my practical work at the university.

I plan to continue utilizing this platform extensively and applying its research insights to further refine my work in academia and beyond
